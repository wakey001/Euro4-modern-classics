### Design choices
***
As this model is the honda civic type r , I based the colors red, black, grey and white . I feel that enthusiasts will appreciate the authnticity of the site as well as subliminally teaching the unknowing user the colors assosiated with hondas type r branding.
#### Fonts
Fonts for my website are from [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I have decided to go with [MATE SC](https://fonts.google.com/?query=mate+sc) as I feel in my opinion this is a modern and current feel and is easy to read.I also chose the same for my header as I feel this contasts well with the main text as when larger its flair is even more noticabe in my opinion.
#### Icons
 Icons for my website are from [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/).The icons I have chosen are in fitting with the headings as they provide a little fun whilst giving a visual cue whilst also making the site feel modern and for a young audience.
#### Colors
I did initially base my colors on the typical branding by Honda of the Civic Type R ,however i felt this was not particularly modern or visually stimulating. ![civic type r advert by honda with the text bye bye gti](ep3-bye-gti.png) .
My initial colours were:
![slategrey]()
![red]()
![black()
![white]()

I then decided to only use these colours on the header in the nav bar and on the footer .
And went for somthing much more digestable and visually relaxing and stimulating in my opinion .
I used a website called coolers for inspiration , although not using one of their many palletes itself one did provide my inspiration. 
My new colours are:
rgb(96, 141,78)
rgb(158,214,56)
rgba(100,36,36,0.6)
rgba(122,212,200,0.6)



I HAVE USED CONTRAST CHECKER ON COOLERS TO MAKE SURE THE TEXT IS EASILY READABLE IN ALL COLORS.I have used
