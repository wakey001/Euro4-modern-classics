***
AS THIS MODEL IS THE HONDA CIVIC TYPE R I BASED THE COLORS ON THE BRANDING OF HONDA WHICH ARE RED AS I FEEL ENTHUSIASTS WILL APPRECIATE THE AUTHENTICY OF THE SITE AS WELL AS TEACHING NON-ENTHUSIASTS ABOUT THE COLORS HONDA LIKE TO ASSOSIATE WITH.
#### FONTS
FONTS FOR MY WEBSITE ARE FROM [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH ...... AS I FEEL IN MY OPINION THIS IS A MODERN AND CURRENT FEEL AND IS EASY TO READ. I ALSO CHOSE ....... FOR MY HEADER AS I FEEL THIS CONTRASTS WELL WITH THE MAIN TEXT OF .....
#### ICONS
ICONS FOR MY WEBSITE ARE FROM THE [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/) THE ICONS I HAVE CHOSEN ARE IN FITTING WITH THE HEADINGS AND IN MY OPINION DO WELL TO ADD EXTRA VISUAL CUES TO HELP MAKE THE SITE FEEL MODERN.
#### COLORS
I HAVE BASED MY COLORS ON THE RED BRANDING OF HONDAS TYPE R BADGE
COLORS HERE .........
