### Design choices
***
As this model is the honda civic type r , I based the colors red, black, grey and white . I feel that enthusiasts will appreciate the authnticity of the site as well as subliminally teaching the unknowing user the colors assosiated with hondas type r branding.
#### Fonts
Fonts for my website are from [GOOGLE FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/). I have decided to go with [MATE SC](https://fonts.google.com/?query=mate+sc) as I feel in my opinion this is a modern and current feel and is easy to read.I also chose the same for my header as I feel this contasts well with the main text as when larger its flair is even more noticabe in my opinion.
#### Icons
 Icons for my website are from [FONT AWESOME LIBRARY](https://fontawesome.com/).The icons I have chosen are in fitting with the headings as they provide a little fun whilst giving a visual cue whilst also making the site feel modern and for a young audience.
#### Colors
I did initially base my colors on the typical branding by Honda of the Civic Type R ,however i felt this was not particularly modern or visually stimulating. ![civic type r advert by honda with the text bye bye gti](ep3-bye-gti.png) .
My initial colours were:
![]()
![red]()
![black()
![white]()

I then decided to only use these colours on the header in the nav bar and on the footer .
And went for somthing much more digestable and visually relaxing and stimulating in my opinion .
I used a website called coolers for inspiration , although not using one of their many palletes itself one did provide my inspiration. 
My new colours are:
rgb(96, 141,78)
rgb(158,214,56)
rgba(100,36,36,0.6)
rgba(122,212,200,0.6)



I HAVE USED CONTRAST CHECKER ON COOLERS TO MAKE SURE THE TEXT IS EASILY READABLE IN ALL COLORS.I have used

### Features
***
#### Existing Features
##### Navigation
For the navbar I have given it a fixed position so that its easy for the user to navigate , along with a smooth scroll css fuction to help with the fluidity and keep the site feeling modern.
##### Hero Image
I have decided to implement a large Hero image based on the Advertising campain by honda , inparticular the colors I found were visually stimulating
##### Welcome Section
I have used three heading running vertically down the page with some text as not to overload the user . These being 50% in width , the other 50% is taken up with an image of a type r to offer stimulation . This then is the height of the three headings with text.
##### Why so special section
On this section I have used a porthole style image with four headings with some text . The emphasis is then on the image making it a strong focal point for the text
##### Gallery
For the gallery I have created a 4 row column with different colours of all the models .This then drops to 3 columns on screens under 1200px and 2 columns under 800px .
##### Form 
For this I have given it a drop down selector for price and a thoughts section which I feel makes it visually more appealing than a long list of text or email boxes.
##### Footer 
In the footer are links to well know used car sites known to both enthusiasts and the general public . I have also made sure these open a new tab and that they will automatically show the model listed rather than the user have to input details . I have also given it a fixed positon so the user can access these easily at any time.
##### Features To Be Implemented
I can envisage the site going in many directions as either a site with guides on common issues and how to fix them ,or a links to rare or discontinued parts. Or another possibility is to feature other models which are also becoming rare classics following the same trend as the other model featured.
##### Bugs
##### Form
Had an issue with my form submit box where I cannot seem to get it to change with the hover function. This was resolved by changing the input type to button type.
##### Mobile device usability
On screen sizes under 450px a margin on the right was apparant . After hours of searching I consulted my mentor who narrowed it down to my hero-image not being wide enough. This was then corrected with a new hero image.

### Testing 
#### Navbar
##### Plan
My first plan an on my intial commits I wanted a nav which was top right of the page . I then felt it wasnt what i wanted so decided to implement a fixed position nav . That way i felt it was easier and more appealing for the user to navigate.
##### Implementation
I implemented the navbar giving it a fixed postion .. I then styled the navbar using css to space the links evenly and add a hover element.
##### Test
To test I clicked all the links to make sure it worksed as it should I have also tested it on various browsers and devices.
##### Result
The navbar works on all devices and browsers
##### Verdict
The test has passed and all criteria met
